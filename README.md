# SummerResearch2024
For the iCompBio REU program Summer of 2024

# General Outline of Summer Research Project:
To build a framework that will take various inputs from college student users, protect their data, and then output recommendations for topics that the student should consider for future study.

# Goal:
Using student input data (that is protected) students are given topics for future study. They then take these topics to advisors, professors, counselors, and peers. These people will help the student pick what courses to take the upcoming semester based on the courses offered at the studentâ€™s school.
